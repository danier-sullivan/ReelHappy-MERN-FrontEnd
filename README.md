# REEL Happy
https://reel-happy.herokuapp.com/

A full stack application developed as a group using the MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. Reel Happy adhered to the MVC (Models, Views and Controllers) file structure on the backend.  Developers applied full CRUD to the movie review page. The site pulls from the server-side OMDB API to provide movie information. The application is deployed using Heroku.

This application is a film review site with a twist: rate movies based on how happy they make you feel. We believe that films are more than just entertainment; they're a reflection of our lives. That's why we've created a platform where you can rate and review films based on your personal definition of happiness.  
    Our community shares a passion for the joy that films can bring. You can easily search for and discover new flicks that make you feel happy, and see what others have rated them. Whether you're a cinema aficionado or just looking for a pick-me-up, Reel Happy is the perfect site for you. So, come join our community of happy movie-goers today and start spreading the joy!
        
Collaboration:
    Team used Trello workspace mangagement, zoom, and slack to coordinate efforts to complete and improve this project

Approach Taken: 
    ReelHappy was developed by a team of four developers.  The team started by creating the backend and frontend framework. They continued by connecting each team member to the GitHub platform.  Code was developed to pull from the API and load the data into a local mongo database.  The information in the mongo database can be updated to include happiness ratings and reviews from the users.  The happiness ratings are then calculated to provide an average happiness rating.  This data is used to pull the top happiest movies which are displayed on the home page.  The information pulled using the search bar adds movies to the browse page. From the browse page users can choose movies that have already been searched and can rate and comment from there.  Team used styling elements and colors designed to be uplifting and happy to match the theme.
    
In development: 
    Given more time, development team would like to add:
      1. User authorization and the ability to save your own movie database
      2. The ability to pull more than one movie title from the API at a time
      3. The ability to search by happiness scale
